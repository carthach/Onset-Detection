C implementation of onset detection method using sprectral flux (difference in the spectrum between frames). Who knows, it might even be fast.

You'll need these libraries, just use your package manager to get them:-

libsndfile - http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/
fftw - http://www.fftw.org/

Followed a C# tutorial here:-

And this paper is also very useful:-
[1] Bello, J. and Daudet, L. 2005. A tutorial on onset detection in music signals. IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing. 13, 5 (2005), 1035â€“1047.

Possibly usable in real-time scenarios (plugins etc.) if you change the peak-picking stage to look back (or delay the incoming signal by a frame or two).
